# Virtru Typography

One, consistent set of fonts for the Virtru brand to be used by designers and engineers across our products.

## What problems does this solve?

### 1. DRY—duplication of font assets

These are the same fonts repeated again and again:

- [ ] GitHub screenshots TBD


### 2. The same fonts coming from different sources

Which is canonical?

- [ ] Adobe Fonts screenshot TBD


### 3. Design programs treating the same fonts as different fonts, locally

- [ ] Sketch screenshot TBD


### 4. New designer onboarding—how do I get fonts locally?

As of 2018, undocumented and thus, inconsistent.
