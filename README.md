# Virtru Typography

One, consistent set of fonts for the Virtru brand to be used by designers and engineers across our products.

## What problems does this solve?

### 1. DRY—duplication of font assets

These are the same fonts repeated again and again:

A. A Browser Plugin
![Virtru BP fonts](./problems/fonts-bp.png)

B. Secure Reader
![Virtru SR fonts](./problems/fonts-sr.png)

C. Dashboard
![Virtru Dashboard fonts](./problems/fonts-dashboard.png)


### 2. The same fonts coming from different sources

Where is this coming from? Which is canonical?

### 3. Design programs treating the same fonts as different fonts, locally

![Sketch missing fonts screenshot](./problems/fonts-Sketch.png)


### 4. New designer onboarding—how do I get fonts locally?

As of 2018, undocumented and thus, inconsistent.
